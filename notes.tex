\section{Setup}

\subsection{Basic idea}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
\item a discrete set of candidate controllers $\mc K = \{K_1,\dots, K_M\}$.
\item  $P$, the part of plant that is known a priori.
\item an {\em initial} description of $\Delta$, the unknown part of the plant, in the form of
  integral quadratic constraints $\mc Q_\Delta = \{Q_1,\dots, Q_L\}$.
\item $\mc W$, a bounded set for the unobserved exogenous noise $w$, in the form of IQCs $\mc Q_{W}$.
\end{itemize}
Goal: learn about the system so that we can find a controller $K\in\mc K$ which stabilizes the
system and optimizes the $\ell_2$ gain $\|T_{w\to y}\|_{\infty}$.


The basic idea of ``controller invalidation'' is as follows.

Consider closed-loop id without a candidate controller $K$ in the system.  \qq{note that open loop
  id does not make sense here.}  Given the observation of length $T$ sequence $(u_t, y_t,
z_t)_{t=1}^{T}$ generated by the system, try to find $(w_t, v_t, s_t)_{t=1}^{T}$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $(z,y,v) = P(u,w,s)$ and $u = K z$.
\item the IQCs $\mc Q_\Delta$ for $(v, s)$ are satisfied.
\item the IQCs $\mc Q_{W}$ for $w$ are satisfied.
\item Performance in terms of $l_2$ gain of $T_{w\to y}$ and the stability is achieved.
\end{itemize}
If we cannot find such $(w,v,s)$, we should rule out $K$ from $\mc K$, otherwise keep it.

We need to do this test for every $K$ in the discrete set $\mc K$ to determine whether to keep it or
throw it out. If more than one $K$ is left, we can try:
\begin{itemize}
\item Get new observations for each $K$ with the same setup. Run the same invalidation procedure.
\item With the same observation, search for better performance so that sub-optimal controllers would
  be ruled out.
\item Impose more IQCs (obtained from observation data) to shrink the uncertainty set of $\Delta$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Invalidation procedure}

For a particular $K$, given the $\mc K,P, \mc Q_{\Delta}, \mc Q_{W}$, given length $T$ observation
$(u_t, y_t, z_t)_{t=1}^{T}$, try to invalidate $K$.

Let's get a bit more concrete for the invalidation procedure and write it out here.

\section{Discussions}

Naive questions
\begin{enumerate}
\item how does this approach compare to controller synthesis with the IQC for $\Delta$? -- we can
  use the observation sequences without id + control.
\end{enumerate}


After studying the 0-th order question.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start with a compact set for $\mc K$, we want to test one instance of $K$ and be able to rule
  out a measurable subset of $\mc K$.
\item Incorporate the information in the observation sequences to get a finer description of the
  uncertainty set $\Delta$ in terms of more IQCs in $\mc Q_{\Delta}$, which would give us more
  invalidation power.
\item Experiment design. Note that in the closed loop id, choosing a particular controller $K$
  determines the $u$ input sequence. We want to select a controller $K\in \mc K$ so that we can
  shave of a large portion of $\mc K$ with the invalidation procedure.
\end{enumerate}
